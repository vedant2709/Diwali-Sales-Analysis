# Diwali-Sales-Analysis
Performing analysis of diwali sales dataset using pandas

In this project I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis on diwali sales to get insights about the data.

In this project most of analysis that I have done is using graphs and visualization so that non-technical person can also be able to understand the insights of data

Conclusion : Married women belonging to age group 26-35 yrs from UP, Maharashtra and Karnataka in IT , Healthcare and Aviation are more likely to by products from Food, 
              Clothing and Electronics category

Thank you!
